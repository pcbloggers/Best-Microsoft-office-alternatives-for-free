<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calligra does not have the familiar look and feel of MS Office. Many of the useful feature tabs are on the right side of the screen rather than the top, as in MS Office and other office suites. This indicates that the page you're working on does not take up the entire screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calligra's mind-mapping and project managing tool make it stand out. But they are costly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
